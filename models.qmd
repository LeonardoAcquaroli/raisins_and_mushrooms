## Description

Raisins can be of two species: *Kecimen* and *Besni*.\
We built different models to predict the species on the basis of the dimensions of the raisin example approximated as an ellipse.

## Variables

The predictors that can be used are:

-   Area	MajorAxisLength
-   MinorAxisLength
-   Eccentricity
-   ConvexArea
-   Extent
-   Perimeter
-   Class_literal

## Supervised models

#### Setup

```         
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(glmnet)
library(estimatr)
library(stats)
library(tree)
library(maxLik)
library(Matrix)
library(caret)

# load the dataset
# Class = 1 if raisin is of Kecimen type, 0 if it is Besni
raisins = read.csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeonardoAcquaroli/raisins_and_mushrooms/main/datasets/Raisin_Dataset.csv",
  sep = ";"
)
# remove the column of the literal class
#raisins = raisins %>% select(-Class_literal) # don't know why it doesn't work
raisins = raisins[,-8]
set.seed(42)
training_index = createDataPartition(raisins$Class, p=0.7, list = FALSE) # index of the train set examples
train = raisins[training_index,]
test = raisins[-training_index,]
```
