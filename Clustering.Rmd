```{r}
data = read.csv('datasets/Raisin_Dataset.csv', sep = ';')
table(data$Class_literal)
```

We exclude the label variable
```{r}
df = data[-c(8, 9)]
head(df)
```

```{r}
km.out = kmeans(df, 2)
km.out
```


Since clusters do not correspond to a specific category, we cannot estimate accuracy. 
However, distribution should be 450-450, but it is 189-711, so the algorithm is clearly not adequate for this dataset.

```{r}
plot (df, col = adjustcolor(km.out$cluster + 1, alpha.f = 0.1),
main = "K- Means Clustering Results with K = 2", pch = 20)
